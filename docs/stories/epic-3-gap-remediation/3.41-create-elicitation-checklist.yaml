# Story Context
context: |
  **EPIC 3 - GAP REMEDIATION**: Create missing elicitation-checklist.md checklist

  This story addresses technical debt identified during Story 3.8 (Incomplete Workflows Part 2).

  **Problem**: Task advanced-elicitation.md needs elicitation-checklist.md checklist but it doesn't exist.

  **Reference**: Story 3.8 completion notes and QA gate recommendation
  - File: docs/qa/gates/3c.3.8-incomplete-workflow-completion-part-2.yml
  - Recommendation: "Create elicitation-checklist.md checklist" (Medium priority, 2-4 hours)

# User Story
story: |
  **As an** AIOS framework developer,
  **I want** an elicitation checklist (elicitation-checklist.md),
  **so that** the advanced-elicitation task can guide structured elicitation workflows.

# Dev Notes
dev_notes:
  context_from_story_3_8: |
    Story 3.8 identified this missing checklist and documented it with TODO comment:

    File: aios-fullstack/aios-core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.md
    ```yaml
    ---
    # TODO: Create elicitation-checklist.md (follow-up story needed)
    # checklists:
    #   - elicitation-checklist.md  # Checklist doesn't exist yet
    data:
      - elicitation-methods.md  # Elicitation technique reference
      - brainstorming-techniques.md  # Brainstorming methods

  checklist_structure: |
    Elicitation Checklist should include:

    ```markdown
    # Advanced Elicitation Checklist

    Use this checklist to guide structured elicitation workflows for requirements gathering,
    problem exploration, and solution design.

    ## Preparation Phase

    - [ ] Identify gaps or ambiguities
    - [ ] Confirm alignment with original objective
    - [ ] Obtain participant confirmation of captured information

    ## Documentation Phase

    - [ ] Structure elicited information into clear document
    - [ ] Include method selection rationale
    - [ ] Document key decisions and trade-offs
    - [ ] Capture follow-up items or open questions
    - [ ] Store session artifacts for future reference
    - [ ] Update related documentation with findings

    ## Quality Checks

    - [ ] All elicitation objectives addressed
