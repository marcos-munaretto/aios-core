# Story Context
context: |
  **EPIC 3 - GAP REMEDIATION**: Create missing change-proposal-tmpl.md template

  This story addresses technical debt identified during Story 3.7 (Incomplete Workflows Part 1).

  **Problem**: Task correct-course.md needs change-proposal-tmpl.md template but it doesn't exist.

  **Reference**: Story 3.7 completion notes and QA gate recommendation
  - File: docs/qa/gates/3c.3.7-incomplete-workflow-completion-part-1.yml
  - Recommendation: "Create change-proposal-tmpl.md template" (Medium priority, 2-4 hours)

# User Story
story: |
  **As an** AIOS framework developer,
  **I want** a change proposal template (change-proposal-tmpl.md) for documenting course corrections,
  **so that** the correct-course task can generate consistent change proposal documents.
