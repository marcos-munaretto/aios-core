## Critical Changes Made During Validation

### Issue #1: Circular Dependency (FIXED) ✅

**Original State:**
```yaml
blocks: ['3.24']      # 3.30 blocks 3.24
blocked_by: ['3.26']  # 3.30 blocked by 3.26
```

**Problem:** Story 3.24 creates the file, Story 3.30 updates it. But 3.30 was blocking 3.24!

**Fixed State:**
```yaml
blocks: []                    # 3.30 doesn't block anything
blocked_by: ['3.26', '3.24']  # 3.30 waits for both
```

**Correct Implementation Sequence:**
1. ✅ Story 3.26 (1MCP Migration) - Complete
2. ⏳ Story 3.24 (Create integration guide with legacy standards)
3. ⏳ Story 3.30 (Add 1MCP section to guide)

---

### Issue #2: Missing Validation Section (ADDED) ✅

**Added:**
```yaml
validation:
  manual_tests:
    - Create test agent using 1MCP standards
    - Create test agent using legacy standards
    - Verify mode detection commands
    - Peer review documentation
    - Walk through migration guide
  success_criteria:
    - Developer can identify mode without confusion
    - Standards unambiguous and actionable
    - Examples work as documented
    - Migration guide successfully converts agents
```

---

### Enhancement #1: Implementation Notes (ADDED) ✅

Added clear file update strategy showing exactly where 1MCP section should be inserted in the guide created by Story 3.24.

---

### Enhancement #2: Related Stories (ADDED) ✅

Added cross-references to help developer understand the broader context:
- Story 3.24: Creates base guide
- Story 3.26: Defines 1MCP behavior
- Story 3.28: Validation script
- Story 3.29: Registration wizard
- Story 3.31: Synthesis updates

---

## Implementation Readiness Checklist

- ✅ Story 3.26 (1MCP Migration) - COMPLETE
- ⏳ Story 3.24 (Integration Standards) - MUST COMPLETE FIRST
- ✅ File paths verified
- ✅ Dependencies correct
- ✅ Content complete in dev_notes
- ✅ Examples provided
- ✅ Validation approach defined
- ✅ No blocking issues

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Implementation):
1. ✅ **DONE**: Fix circular dependency
2. ✅ **DONE**: Add validation section
3. ✅ **DONE**: Update changelog

### During Implementation:
1. Wait for Story 3.24 to complete
2. Read `agent-tool-integration-guide.md` created by 3.24
3. Copy content from dev_notes sections:
   - `one_mcp_standards_section`
   - `legacy_standards_section` (verify matches 3.24)
   - `migration_guide`
   - `mode_detection_guidance`
4. Insert 1MCP section BEFORE legacy section
5. Run through validation checklist

### After Implementation:
1. Execute all manual tests
2. Verify success criteria met
3. Peer review documentation
4. Update Story 3.24 references if needed
