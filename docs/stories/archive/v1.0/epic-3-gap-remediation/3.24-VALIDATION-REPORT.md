## Critical Changes Made During Validation

### Issue #1: Circular Dependency (FIXED) ✅

**Original State:**
```yaml
blocks: []                    # ❌ Should block 3.23, 3.30
blocked_by: ['3.21', '3.23']  # ❌ Can't be blocked by 3.23!
```

**Problem:** 
- Story 3.24 creates standards
- Story 3.23 (wizard) uses those standards
- Story 3.30 adds to those standards
- But 3.24 was blocked by 3.23! (backwards)

**Fixed State:**
```yaml
blocks: ['3.23', '3.30']      # ✅ Blocks stories that need standards
blocked_by: ['3.21']          # ✅ Only blocked by validation (Done)
```

**Correct Implementation Sequence:**
1. ✅ Story 3.21 (Tool Validation) - Done
2. ⏳ Story 3.24 (Create standards guide) - Ready
3. ⏳ Story 3.23 (Registration wizard uses standards)
4. ⏳ Story 3.30 (Add 1MCP section to standards)

---

### Issue #2: Missing Validation Section (ADDED) ✅

**Added:**
```yaml
validation:
  manual_tests:
    - Review integration guide for completeness
    - Create test agent using elicitation
    - Verify tool ID validation
    - Test autocomplete from registry
    - Test migration checklist
    - Peer review documentation
  success_criteria:
    - Guide exists with all 7 sections
    - Elicitation follows standards automatically
    - Validation prevents invalid formats
    - Migration guide works
```

---

### Issue #3: Story 3.5 Reference Error (FIXED) ✅

**Location:** Dev notes validation checklist (line 212)

**Changed:**
```yaml
# Before
- [ ] Pre-commit validation passes (Story 3.5)  # ❌ Doesn't exist

# After
- [ ] Pre-commit validation passes (Story 3.22)  # ✅ Correct
```

---

### Issue #4: Missing README.md Task (ADDED) ✅

**Added to Task 1:**
```yaml
- 'Create/update .aios-core/agents/README.md with link to integration guide'
```

---

### Enhancement #1: Story 3.30 Integration (ADDED) ✅

Added to context:
```yaml
**IMPORTANT**: This story creates LEGACY MODE standards. 
Story 3.30 will later ADD 1MCP mode standards to the same guide.

**Implementation Scope:**
- This story: Create guide with LEGACY standards
- Story 3.30: Add "1MCP Mode Standards" section
- Result: Unified guide supporting both modes
```

## Recommended Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Create Standards Guide (1.5h)
1. Copy content from `dev_notes.standards_guide_outline`
2. Create `docs/architecture/agent-tool-integration-guide.md`
3. Paste all 7 sections
4. Create/update `.aios-core/agents/README.md`

### Task 2: Update Elicitation (1h)
1. Copy code from `dev_notes.elicitation_updates`
2. Modify `.aios-core/elicitation/agent-elicitation.js`
3. Test with new agent creation
4. Verify validation works

### Task 3: Audit & Migrate (0.5h)
1. Run grep commands from `dev_notes.migration_audit`
2. Identify agents needing updates
3. Add migration section to guide
4. Estimate effort

### Validation:
1. Run through all 10 manual tests
2. Verify all 9 success criteria
3. Peer review documentation

- ✨ **Zero hallucinations**: All content verified (after fixing Story 3.5 ref)
- ✨ **Clear structure**: 7-section guide with DO/DON'T examples
- ✨ **Complete implementation**: JavaScript code ready for elicitation
- ✨ **Self-contained**: Developer needs no external context

### Weaknesses (All Fixed)
- ✅ Circular dependency - FIXED
- ✅ Missing validation - FIXED
- ✅ Story reference error - FIXED
- ✅ Missing README task - FIXED

### Risk Level
**LOW** - Documentation story with clear requirements and complete content

## Dependencies Status

| Story | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 3.21 | Tool Validation | ✅ Done | Dependency satisfied |
| 3.23 | Registration Wizard | ⏳ Draft | Blocked BY this story (correct) |
| 3.30 | 1MCP Standards | ⏳ Ready | Blocked BY this story (correct) |

---

## Approval

**Validation Status:** ✅ **GO**

**Approved for Implementation:** Yes (Story 3.21 is Done)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 3 hours (as estimated)

**Priority:** Medium (but blocks 2 other stories)

---

## Implementation Priority

**RECOMMENDED: HIGH PRIORITY**

**Rationale:**
- Blocks Story 3.23 (Registration Wizard - 5h)
- Blocks Story 3.30 (1MCP Standards - 1.5h)
- Combined blocked work: 6.5 hours
- Implementing 3.24 first unblocks 6.5h of work

**Impact:**
- Prevents future tool name ambiguity
- Enables automatic standards compliance
- Foundation for Stories 3.23 and 3.30
