# Story Context
context: |
  **EPIC 3 - GAP REMEDIATION**: Create missing impact-assessment-checklist.md checklist

  This story addresses technical debt identified during Story 3.8 (Incomplete Workflows Part 2).

  **Problem**: Task analyze-impact.md needs impact-assessment-checklist.md checklist but it doesn't exist.

  **Reference**: Story 3.8 completion notes and QA gate recommendation
  - File: docs/qa/gates/3c.3.8-incomplete-workflow-completion-part-2.yml
  - Recommendation: "Create impact-assessment-checklist.md checklist" (Medium priority, 2-4 hours)

# User Story
story: |
  **As an** AIOS framework developer,
  **I want** an impact assessment checklist (impact-assessment-checklist.md),
  **so that** the analyze-impact task can systematically assess modification impacts.

# Dev Notes
dev_notes:
  context_from_story_3_8: |
    Story 3.8 identified this missing checklist and documented it with TODO comment:

    File: aios-fullstack/aios-core/tasks/analyze-impact.md
    ```yaml
    ---
    # TODO: Create impact-assessment-checklist.md (follow-up story needed)

      - change-propagation-predictor  # Predict change impacts
      - modification-risk-assessment  # Risk assessment

    Impact Assessment Checklist should include:

    ```markdown
    # Impact Assessment Checklist

    Use this checklist to systematically assess the impact of component modifications
    on the broader AIOS-FULLSTACK framework.

    ## Component Discovery

    - [ ] Identify target component for modification
    - [ ] Validate component exists and is accessible
    - [ ] Document component type (agent/task/workflow/util)
    - [ ] Document current component version
    - [ ] Identify modification type (modify/deprecate/remove/refactor)

    ## Dependency Analysis

    - [ ] Identify all direct dependencies (components that target depends on)
    - [ ] Identify all reverse dependencies (components that depend on target)
    - [ ] Document external dependencies (libraries, APIs, services)
    - [ ] Map dependency graph depth and breadth
    - [ ] Identify circular dependencies if any
    - [ ] Assess dependency criticality (critical/high/medium/low)

    ## Change Propagation Analysis

    - [ ] Predict propagation scope (localized/moderate/widespread/system-wide)
    - [ ] Identify all affected components by category
    - [ ] Assess breaking change potential
    - [ ] Document API contract changes
    - [ ] Identify migration path requirements
    - [ ] Estimate effort for dependent component updates

    ## Risk Assessment

    - [ ] Calculate overall risk level (low/medium/high/critical)
    - [ ] Identify technical risks
    - [ ] Identify business risks
    - [ ] Identify operational risks
    - [ ] Assess risk probability for each identified risk
    - [ ] Assess risk impact for each identified risk
    - [ ] Calculate risk scores (probability × impact)

    ## Mitigation Planning

    - [ ] Document mitigation strategy for each high-risk item
    - [ ] Define rollback procedures
    - [ ] Identify testing requirements
    - [ ] Plan communication strategy for affected teams
    - [ ] Create migration guide if needed
    - [ ] Define validation checkpoints

    ## Approval Workflow

    - [ ] Generate impact assessment report
    - [ ] Identify required approvers based on risk level
    - [ ] Submit for review (if high-risk)
    - [ ] Document approval decisions
    - [ ] Obtain necessary sign-offs before proceeding

    ## Quality Checks

    - [ ] All dependencies identified and documented
    - [ ] Impact assessment is comprehensive
    - [ ] Risk mitigation strategies are actionable
    - [ ] Approval workflow completed (if required)
    - [ ] Documentation meets project standards
    ```

  modification_types: |
    Different modification types require different assessment focus:
    - **Modify**: Focus on API compatibility and behavior changes
    - **Deprecate**: Focus on migration path and timeline
    - **Remove**: Focus on reverse dependencies and alternatives
    - **Refactor**: Focus on behavior preservation and test coverage

  risk_thresholds: |
    Risk-based approval requirements:
    - **Critical Risk** (20-25): Requires architecture review + approval
    - **High Risk** (13-19): Requires team lead approval
    - **Medium Risk** (6-12): Standard review process
    - **Low Risk** (1-5): No additional approval needed

  files_to_create:
    - ".aios-core/checklists/impact-assessment-checklist.md"

  files_to_modify:
    - "aios-fullstack/aios-core/tasks/analyze-impact.md"

  validation_approach: |
    1. Execute checklist with sample modification scenarios
    2. Verify all assessment phases covered systematically
    3. Validate risk calculations align with risk-profile methodology
    4. Confirm checklist items are clear and actionable
