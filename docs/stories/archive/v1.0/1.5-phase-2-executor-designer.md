I want **PV coherence scanning for executor assessment**,
so that **I recommend executors aligned with systemic coherence principles**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC1**: executor-designer-pv.md created with PV mind integration
- [x] **AC2**: Executor assessment uses PV_PA_001 (Coherence Scan) heuristic
- [x] **AC3**: Veto enforced for truthfulness <0.7 (incoherent executors rejected)
- [x] **AC4**: Executor recommendations include coherence scores and rationale
- [x] **AC5**: Integration tests verify backward compatibility
- [x] **AC6**: Documentation updated with coherence assessment examples

---

## Integration Verification

- [x] **IV1**: Existing executor selection workflows preserved
- [x] **IV2**: Coherence scores add value without blocking valid executors
- [x] **IV3**: Veto conditions validated against real scenarios

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Agent Refactoring (2 days)

1. **Create executor-designer-pv.md**
   - Duplicate existing executor-designer agent
   - Add PV mind integration via `applyToAgent()` pattern
   - Preserve all existing commands

2. **Integrate PV_PA_001 Heuristic**
   - Load compiled `Systemic Coherence Scan` function
   - Apply to executor assessment:
     ```javascript
     const coherenceScan = compiledHeuristic({
       truthfulness: truthfulnessScore,        // 0-1 scale (VETO <0.7)
       systemAdherence: systemAdherenceScore,  // 0-1 scale (weight: 0.8)
       skill: technicalSkillScore              // 0-1 scale (weight: 0.3)
     });

     if (coherenceScan.veto) {
       return {
         recommendation: 'REJECT',
         reason: coherenceScan.vetoReason,
         vetoTrigger: 'TRUTHFULNESS_BELOW_THRESHOLD'
       };
     }

     // Weighted score: (T*1.0 + S*0.8 + K*0.3) / 2.1
     ```

3. **Add Coherence Scoring**
   - Generate coherence score (0-1 scale)
   - Classify: EXCELLENT (≥0.9), GOOD (≥0.8), ACCEPTABLE (≥0.6), POOR (<0.6)
   - Provide reasoning for score

### Phase B: Testing (1 day)

4. **Unit Tests**
   - Test veto enforcement (truthfulness <0.7)
   - Test weighted scoring
   - Test recommendation logic (APPROVE/REVIEW/REJECT)
   - Test dual-mode fallback

5. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end executor assessment
   - Verify existing workflows unaffected
   - Performance benchmark (<100ms overhead)

### Phase C: Documentation (0.5 days)

6. **Update Agent Documentation**
   - Document PV_PA_001 integration
   - Add coherence assessment examples
   - Document veto conditions and overrides

---

## Coherence Scan Algorithm Application

PV_PA_001 prioritizes **truthfulness above all else** with veto power:

**Example Scenario 1: High Skill, Low Truthfulness**
```yaml
Executor: Senior Developer
  truthfulness: 0.65  # ⚠️ BELOW VETO THRESHOLD
  systemAdherence: 0.85
  skill: 0.95

Heuristic Output:
  score: 0  # Veto triggered
  veto: true
  vetoReason: "TRUTHFULNESS_BELOW_THRESHOLD (0.65 < 0.7)"
  recommendation: REJECT
  reasoning: "Truthfulness veto power overrides high technical skill.
             Cannot recommend executor with coherence issues."
```

**Example Scenario 2: Balanced Executor**
```yaml
Executor: Mid-Level Developer
  truthfulness: 0.85
  systemAdherence: 0.75
  skill: 0.70

Heuristic Output:
  score: 0.78  # (0.85*1.0 + 0.75*0.8 + 0.70*0.3) / 2.1
  veto: false
  recommendation: APPROVE
  hierarchyRank: GOOD
  reasoning: "Strong truthfulness (0.85) with good system fit (0.75).
             Technical skills adequate (0.70). Recommended."
```

**Behavioral Evidence:**
> "Demissão dos filmmakers tecnicamente superiores mas que mentiam consistentemente.
> O parâmetro 'truthfulness_coherence' foi violado, tornando 'technical_skill' irrelevante."

```

### Reference Patterns from Story 1.4

**Agent Structure** (from `process-architect-pv.md`):
- Mind loading via `const { loadMind } = require('../utils/mind-loader')`
- Heuristic compilation via `compileHeuristic()` pattern
- Dual-mode support (PV mode + Generic fallback)
- Session-scoped instances (no singletons)

**PV_PA_001 Integration** (Coherence Scan):
```javascript
const coherenceScan = compiledHeuristic({
  truthfulness: truthfulnessScore,        // 0-1 scale (VETO <0.7)
  systemAdherence: systemAdherenceScore,  // 0-1 scale (weight: 0.8)
  skill: technicalSkillScore              // 0-1 scale (weight: 0.3)
});

// Veto enforcement (truthfulness <0.7)
if (coherenceScan.veto) {
  return {
    recommendation: 'REJECT',
    reason: coherenceScan.vetoReason,
    vetoTrigger: 'TRUTHFULNESS_BELOW_THRESHOLD'
  };
}

// Weighted score: (T*1.0 + S*0.8 + K*0.3) / 2.1
const coherenceScore = (
  truthfulness * 1.0 +
  systemAdherence * 0.8 +
  skill * 0.3
) / 2.1;
```

**Executor Recommendation Logic**:
- EXCELLENT: coherenceScore ≥0.9
- GOOD: coherenceScore ≥0.8
- ACCEPTABLE: coherenceScore ≥0.6
- POOR: coherenceScore <0.6 (or veto triggered)

### Testing

**Test Framework**: `node:test` with TAP output format (following Story 1.4 pattern)

**Test File Location**: `.claude/commands/hybridOps/tests/executor-integration.test.js`

**Expected Test Coverage**: ~20-25 tests covering:

1. **PV_PA_001 Coherence Scan Tests** (6-7 tests)
   - Veto enforcement: truthfulness 0.65 → REJECT
   - High skill override failure: truthfulness 0.65, skill 0.95 → REJECT (veto power)
   - Balanced executor: truthfulness 0.85, systemAdherence 0.75, skill 0.70 → APPROVE
   - Edge case: truthfulness exactly 0.7 (veto threshold boundary)
   - Weighted scoring formula validation
   - Recommendation classification (EXCELLENT/GOOD/ACCEPTABLE/POOR)

2. **Veto Logic Tests** (3-4 tests)
   - Truthfulness <0.7 triggers veto
   - Veto overrides high skill and system adherence
   - Veto reason formatting
   - No veto when truthfulness ≥0.7

3. **Dual-Mode Fallback Tests** (2-3 tests)
   - PV mode active when mind loaded
   - Generic mode when mind unavailable
   - Graceful degradation without errors

4. **Integration Tests** (4-5 tests)
   - End-to-end executor assessment workflow
   - Performance benchmark: <100ms overhead per assessment
   - Session-scoped mind loading (no singletons)
   - Existing workflows unaffected

5. **Scenario Validation Tests** (2 tests)
   - Verify High Skill, Low Truthfulness scenario (lines 99-113)
   - Verify Balanced Executor scenario (lines 115-129)

**Test Execution**: `node .claude/commands/hybridOps/tests/executor-integration.test.js`

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% test pass rate (following Story 1.4 benchmark: 22/22 tests passing)
- Execution time <100ms total
- TAP output format compliance

**Reference**: Story 1.4 test structure (688 lines, 22 tests, 6 suites, 100% pass rate, 17.88ms execution)

---

## Success Metrics

- **Quality**: 100% truthfulness veto enforcement
- **Accuracy**: Coherence scores correlate with Pedro's actual assessments
- **Safety**: No false rejections of good executors
- **Performance**: <100ms validation overhead per assessment
- **Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue working without modification

---

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Truthfulness scoring too subjective
- **Mitigation**: Provide objective behavioral indicators
- **Examples**: Delivery track record, communication clarity, error acknowledgment
- **Pedro validation**: Review truthfulness assessments

**Risk 2**: Veto too strict (rejects valid executors)
- **Mitigation**: 0.7 threshold validated against historical decisions
- **Override mechanism**: Allow manual override with justification
- **Calibration**: Adjust threshold based on false rejection rate

**Risk 3**: Skill weight too low (0.3) undervalues capability
- **Mitigation**: This is intentional (PV principle: coherence > capability)
- **Documentation**: Explain why truthfulness matters more than skill
- **Configuration**: Make weights tunable via config system (Story 1.7)

## Notes

This agent enforces one of PV's strongest principles: **truthfulness as non-negotiable foundation**. The veto power reflects real behavioral evidence (filmmaker demission story).

Key principle: **Coherence in belief systems > Technical capability**

This may seem counterintuitive to traditional hiring practices, but it aligns with PV's long-term success pattern of prioritizing systemic fit over immediate skill.
