## 📋 Objective

Create YouTube demo video showing complete AIOS workflow: from idea to production-grade AI agent in 15 minutes, highlighting unique differentiators (MCP optimization, CodeRabbit, Supabase automation).

---

## 🎯 Scope

Record 15-minute screencast demonstrating: create agent → configure MCPs (1MCP presets) → deploy to Railway → database setup (Supabase) → live in production. Highlight 3 unique features: 85% token reduction (280K → 40K), automatic code review (CodeRabbit), database automation. Upload to YouTube, optimize for discovery.

### 15-Minute Deploy Demo Video
**Location:** `YouTube`

Complete demo video showing AIOS workflow from idea to production in 15 minutes.

---

## 💰 Investment Breakdown

- Hours 1-3 (Script & Setup): $375
- Hours 4-5 (Recording & Editing): $250
- Hour 6 (Upload & Optimization): $125
- Total: $750

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Video Completion:** 15-minute demo uploaded to YouTube
- **Quality:** Single-take or minimal editing required
- **Discovery Optimization:** Title, tags, description optimized for search

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Demo fails during recording (technical issues)
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Test demo flow beforehand, prepare backup environment, allow 2 takes

---

## 📝 Notes

Demo validates market demand before open-sourcing repos. KILL SWITCH: If video gets <1,000 upvotes + <500 waitlist → defer open-source (Epic 10), refine value prop.
