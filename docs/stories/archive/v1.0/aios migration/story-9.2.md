## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** KILL SWITCH triggers value prop refinement, delay open-source until validated

- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Engage with feedback, iterate on messaging, prepared to pivot if needed

## 📝 Notes

Completes Epic 9 (Phase 0). KILL SWITCH at end of week: If <1,000 upvotes + <500 waitlist → ABORT Epic 10, refine value prop, re-launch Phase 0. If GO → proceed to Epic 10 (Phase 1: Open MCP Ecosystem).
