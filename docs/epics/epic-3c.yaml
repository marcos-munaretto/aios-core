    - Sarah (@po)
    - Winston (@architect)
  note: "This was 'Epic 3B' in first proposal. Now renamed to 3C."

overview:
  goal: "Systematically resolve 324 gaps discovered during architecture audit"
  strategicFocus: "Reactive remediation of technical debt"
  size:
    stories: 21
    estimatedHours: ~110
  targetCompletion: "Ongoing (12-15 sprints)"
  prerequisite: null
  canRunParallel: true
  parallelWith: ["Epic 3A", "Epic 3B"]
  note: "Can begin in parallel with Epic 3A/3B (no blocking dependencies)"

rationale:
  problem: "324 architecture gaps discovered in Stories 2.11-2.13 creating technical debt"
  solution: "Systematic remediation categorized by type: orphaned entities, workflows, framework enhancements, cleanup"
  strategicImpact:
    - "Resolves accumulated technical debt"
    - "Unblocks agent functionality (broken references)"
    - "Improves framework discoverability"

valueProposition:
  investment: "~110 hours (21 stories)"
  returns:
    - "Clean architecture"
    - "Reduced technical debt"
    - "Improved framework usability"
    - "Unblocked agent functionality"
  currentProgress: "7/21 stories completed (33%)"

successCriteria:
  - criterion: "Gap count reduced from 324 to <200"
    metric: "38% reduction in total gaps"
    validation: "Run architecture audit after completion"

  - criterion: "All CRITICAL broken references resolved"
    metric: "100% CRITICAL gaps fixed"
    validation: "No CRITICAL gaps in audit results"

  - criterion: "All HIGH priority orphaned entities integrated or deprecated"
    metric: "100% HIGH priority items addressed"
    validation: "Review HIGH priority gap list"

  - criterion: "Framework utilities audit complete"
    metric: "All 67 utilities categorized and documented"
    validation: "Utilities audit report approved"

  - criterion: "All workflow definitions completed"
    metric: "100% workflow definitions have complete steps"
    validation: "No incomplete workflow markers in codebase"

    **🏆 PATTERN MASTERY ACHIEVED - 85% UTILITY INTEGRATION COMPLETE** 🎉
    
    Stories 3.4, 3.5, & 3.6 completed with PROGRESSIVE EXCELLENCE:
    - Story 3.4: 92/100 QA score, 87% operational rate (Established pattern)
    - Story 3.5: 94/100 QA score, 95% operational rate (Refined pattern)
    - Story 3.6: 98/100 QA score, **100% operational rate** (Perfected pattern) 🏆
    - Pattern consistency: 98% demonstrates mature, repeatable excellence
    - **57/67 utilities integrated (85% of Category 1)**
    - **ZERO technical debt in Story 3.6** (cleanest implementation)
    
    **PATTERN MASTERY ACHIEVEMENT:**
    - Quality progression: 92 → 94 → 98 (+6 points)
    - Operational trend: 87% → 95% → 100% (+13 percentage points)
    - Technical debt: 3 issues → 1 issue → 0 issues (eliminated)
    - This demonstrates framework process maturity at its peak
    
    **DECISION POINT - Strategic Options:**
    
    **Option A: Complete Category 1 (10 utilities remaining)**
    ✅ **Ad-hoc Integration:** Final 10 utilities (2-3h)
       - Achieve 100% utility integration (67/67)
       - Complete Category 1 (Orphaned Entity Integration)
       - Use proven pattern (100% success expected)
       - Quick win to closure
       
    **Option B: Pivot to HIGH Priority Work (RECOMMENDED)**
    ✅ **Story 3.1:** Orphaned Task Integration (40h)
       - Large story - needs validation/split (2-3h PO work)
       - QA noted possible gap count inflation
       - High priority gap remediation
       
    ✅ **Story 3.16:** Data Architecture Capability (24h)
       - High strategic value (Supabase specialist)
       - Clear deliverable (1 new agent)
       - Multi-sprint effort
    
    **Epic 3B:** COMPLETE (100%) ✅
    **Recommended Next Action:** Pivot to HIGH priority work OR complete final 10 utilities
